# CONTRIBUTING


Welcome to the Python code snippet for LangGraph using Google Gemini (ChatGoogleGenerativeAI), and thank you for your interest in contributing!

This guide is chiefly for users wishing to contribute to the project.


## ⚡ Development

Below are the tools used during development. Please ensure that you always **start your contributions by creating a feature branch from the "main" branch.**

:exclamation: Note: Ensure that **Python version 3.12.x** is installed on your local machine, as it is the version compatible with this documentation.

#### 🌱 Managing dependencies

Based on [UV](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)

- Create Python environment
    ```bash
    uv venv
    ```
- Activate environment
    ```bash
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```
- Install Python libraries
    ```bash
    uv pip install -r pyproject.toml --group dev
    ```
- Remove Python libraries
    ```bash
    uv remove pandas
    ```

#### 🌱 Initializing pre-commit

Pre-commit settings are available in `.pre-commit-config.yaml`

- [Install pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/#install)
    ```bash
    pip install pre-commit
    ```
- Verify pre-commit version: currently using  4.0.1
    ```bash
    pre-commit --version
    ```
- Run pre-commit.
    ```bash
    pre-commit run
    ```

#### 🌱 Versioning with Commitizen


Based on [Commitizen](https://commitizen-tools.github.io/commitizen/)

Settings are available in `pyproject.toml`

- Write clear and meaningful commit messages following the standard [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/). Each commit should include the following structural elements to clearly communicate the intent to other developers and consumers of the code.

- **Always commit** using the commitizen helper.
    ```bash
    cz commit
    ```
- **Always bump version** updating changelog file.
    ```bash
     cz bump --changelog
    ```

#### 🌱 Run Poe tasks

Settings are available in `poe.toml`

Based on [Poe The Poet](https://poethepoet.natn.io/index.html)

- Check what tasks are available.
    ```bash
    poe
    ```
- Run an specific task (e.g. linting code).
    ```bash
    poe lint
    ```

## ⚡ How create pull requests

Here are the steps to create a Pull Request.

- Make your code contributions in a dedicated feature branch (**created from "main" branch**).

- Run the linter to check the code content.
    ```bash
    poe lint
    ```
- Run unit tests and ensure there is no reduction in test coverage by checking htmlcov/index.html
    ```bash
    poe test
    ```
- Commit your changes using Commitizen for standardized commit messages.
    ```bash
    cz commit
    ```
- If necessary, create a new release version and bump the version number.
    ```bash
    cz bump --changelog
    ```
- If the previous step was successful, push your code and create a pull request to the "main" branch for code review.
