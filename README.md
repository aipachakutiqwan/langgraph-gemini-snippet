# langgraph-gemini-snippet

Welcome to Python code snippet for LangGraph using Google Gemini (ChatGoogleGenerativeAI)!

## âš¡ Introduction

This repository contains a collection of code snippets designed to help you learn LangGraph using ChatGoogleGenerativeAI as the LLM backend. Its purpose is to provide concise examples that demonstrate core LangGraph concepts. Each script highlights a specific concept for easy understanding and experimentation.The snippets are inspired by the official LangGraph course, which is publicly available.

:heavy_exclamation_mark: This snippet is not intended for direct use in production. Do not use it as-is. Instead, use it as a reference: extract the core concept, refactor the code to suit your needs, write appropriate unit tests, and only then consider using it in a production environment.
