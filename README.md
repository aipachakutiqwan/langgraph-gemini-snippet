# langgraph-gemini-snippet

Welcome to Python code snippet for LangGraph using Google Gemini (ChatGoogleGenerativeAI)!

## âš¡ Introduction

This repository contains a collection of code snippets designed to help you learn LangGraph using ChatGoogleGenerativeAI as the LLM backend. Its purpose is to provide concise examples that demonstrate core LangGraph concepts. Each script highlights a specific concept for easy understanding and experimentation.The snippets are inspired by the official LangGraph course, which is publicly available.

:heavy_exclamation_mark: **This snippet is not intended for direct use in production**. Do not use it as-is. Instead, use it as a reference: extract the core concept, refactor the code to suit your needs, write appropriate unit tests, and only then consider using it in a production environment.

:pushpin: Introduction

This module contains introductory code snippets for LangGraph, designed to demystify agents by explaining how they work in plain language. The examples demonstrate how to build simple agents using core abstractions such as states, nodes, and edges. You'll see how to construct graphs around chat modelsâ€”specifically Geminiâ€”using tools and messages. Finally, the module introduces a basic agent with memory.

:pushpin: State and Memory

This section provides code snippets demonstrating the importance of memory in agents, as users often expect agents to remember past interactions. It includes examples of implementing memory and adding persistence to the graph using both internal and external tools (SQLite). Techniques such as trimming, filtering, and summarization are used to manage long message histories effectively.

:pushpin: Human in the Loop

These code snippets demonstrate how to incorporate human approval before executing certain actions using breakpoints, as well as how to update graph states based on user input. LangGraph Studio is used to debug and visualize the agents behaviour.


:pushpin: Building Assistant

This module includes a Research Assistant agent designed to streamline tedious and repetitive tasks. The agent operates with an overall goal broken down into subtasks, leveraging parallelization and subgraphs to optimize execution.


:pushpin: Long-term Memory

Includes code snippets demonstrating long-term memory, showing how to store conversations using dictionary-based data structures.

:pushpin: Deployment

This section provides an example of how to build agent code and deploy it as a container. Once deployed, the agent can be easily accessed and interacted with using the LangGraph SDK.
